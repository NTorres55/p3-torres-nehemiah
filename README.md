# Issues I had
1. I ran into a huge brick wall with my code - not sure what was going on. After struggling for hours/days of what it could be, thinking it was all wrong, I didn't have the b capitalized in ElementById.
2. I couldn't quite figure out how to add new elements to code and make them toggle 'hide' when they were supposed to. For instance - I wanted to ask a question on each page. I couldn't seem to add a new paragraph or header without throwing off my fortune teller squares.

# Resources
1. I used the prerecorded and recorded lectures
